When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When working from multiple machines, or collaborating.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

For the same reason you don't want Git auto-commiting changes. They might not make-sense/work.
