When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When working from multiple machines, or collaborating.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

For the same reason you don't want Git auto-commiting changes. They might not make-sense/work.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks copy a repository to your github while keeping a link to the original. (Might be able to merge too?)
Clones are for full on copying a git.
Branches are for different versions. Like an experimental version, or a new language.
You'd use forks to try other peoples projects, clones for just copying stuff, and branches for experimenting/trying new versions.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

You can know where in the history of the repo you are. Whether you're ahead, behind, or out of sync.


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

I guess something like Google Drive or email? It's definitely be much harder than Git's awesome collab system.
