What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It makes a new Git repository, but it doesn't make a commit. You have to tell it what files you're saving, and make the first commit yourself.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It's the middle-man that manages what's backed up. It's valuable in that it can be set up, then saved. It's quite important.
